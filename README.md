# Web-Dev
Description:
Welcome to my web development journey! üöÄ This repository is a collection of projects, experiments, and learning materials as I delve into the exciting world of web development, with a primary focus on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. As a beginner, I'm exploring these technologies to build interactive and dynamic web applications.

Learning Focus:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
MongoDB (M)
Express.js (E)
React (R)
Node.js (N)
Git Version Control
Responsive Design and Accessibility
How to Use:
Feel free to explore the projects, check out the source code, and provide any feedback or suggestions. If you're also a fellow learner or experienced developer, I'd love to connect and learn from your experiences.

Resources:
I'll be documenting my learning journey, sharing useful resources, and writing about challenges I encounter along the way in the project's wiki.
